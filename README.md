# Yantao Liu

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Yantao Liu â€” currently a **Researcher** at [**Qwen**](https://qwen.ai).  
I co-lead research and development in **reward modeling**, and also work on reinforcement learning training for large language models (LLMs).
Before graduation, I was a research intern in [**Z.AI**](https://z.ai/) and [**THU-KEG**](https://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/team), work closely with **Zijun Yao**, **Yixin Cao** And **Juanzi Li**.

ðŸ‘‰ For my full list of publications, please refer to my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CKieAy4AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra).

> At Qwen, We are always looking forward to talented intern/researchers/engineers to join us! If you are interested (especially in reward modeling or RLHF), please feel free to [reach out to me](mailto:jiawei.lyt@alibaba-inc.com).

## ðŸš€ Selected Publication
- [**RM-Bench**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16184) â€” A benchmark that tests reward models on subtle content differences and style bias resistance to better align language models.
- [**PairJudge-RM**](https://arxiv.org/html/2501.13007v2) â€” A pairwise reward model using knockout tournaments to improve Best-of-N sampling for LLMs.

If youâ€™re interested in **reward modeling** or any of my pub, feel free to [email me personal email](mailto:ricardoliu@outlook.com)!
