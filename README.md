ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Yantao Liu â€” currently a **Senior Algorithm Engineer** at **Qwen**.  
My work focuses on **Reward Modeling** and **Reinforcement Learning training** of LLMs.

ðŸ‘‰ For my full list of publications, please refer to my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CKieAy4AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra).

## ðŸš€ Favorite Projects
- [**RM-Bench**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16184) â€” A benchmark that tests reward models on subtle content differences and style bias resistance to better align language models.
- [**PairJudge-RM**](https://arxiv.org/html/2501.13007v2) â€” A pairwise reward model using knockout tournaments to improve Best-of-N sampling for LLMs.
- [**HelpSteer3**](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/HelpSteer3) â€” An open-source dataset for training models to generate more helpful responses to user prompts.
